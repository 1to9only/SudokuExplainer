   All the <c>potential positions</c> of the value <g><b>{1}</b></g> are in the <b1>{2}</b1> shown.
   Candidates of the value <r><b>{1}</b></r> in intersecting cells in regions outside the <b1>{2}</b1> can be eliminated.

  <p>
   The <r>other potential positions</r> of the value <b>{1}</b> that are in the other regions(s) can therefore be removed.
